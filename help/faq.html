        <h2>The Riven (TM) Journals FAQ</h2>

        <h4>What are The Riven Journals?</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <p>This site is based upon and related to <b>Riven</b>, the sequel to the CD-ROM bestseller <b>Myst (R)</b>.
                The <b>Journals</b> are a collection of books that introduce and provide commentary on elements found in the game.
                Each <b>Journal</b> also contains a puzzle that, when solved, reveals the subject of the <b>Journal</b> in a new light.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>How does the site work?</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <p>There are two major modes of operation within the first four <b>Journals</b>: external views and immersive views.
                You enter the site in an external view of the room where the <b>Journals</b> are kept.
                Clicking on objects brings you closer to them, and in most views clicking in the black margins near an object takes you further out.
                Immersive views present the pages within each <b>Journal</b>.
                Clicking on different watermarks will take you from page to page, to the puzzle page, or out of the immersive view.
            <p>The fifth <b>Journal</b> operates only in external views and has several puzzles... the opening of the book itself being one.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>How many Journals are there?</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The fifth and final <b>Journal</b> was added to the site on August 25th.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>What happens when a puzzle is solved?</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The site is keeping track of your progress and presents things to you differently in certain situations.
                Observe carefully and you may find some very interesting things.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Are the Journals part of the Riven game?</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Only in a very indirect way. The <b>Journals</b> are designed to explore some of the details of <b>Riven</b>
                without giving anything away that would spoil playing and winning the game.
                If you study the <b>Journals</b> carefully, you may learn things that enrich your <b>Riven</b> experience,
                but you will still find out very little about what lies ahead in the actual game.
