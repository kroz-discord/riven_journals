But youprobably already knew that. <p>UNIX systems won't receive inline audio (though the sounds within theJava applets will still play on many systems).<p>Attention IRIX users - the puzzles take a long, long, time to launch on SGI machines, but once they're up they work just fine. Once you see the D'ni watch image, you have four or five minutes to go.</blockquote><h4>Supported Browsers - Other Platforms</h4><blockquote><p><b>The Riven Journals</b> was developed primarily with Windows andMachintosh users in mind. We will test for other Java-enabled systems inthe future (such as WebTV if/when Java is implemented), but cannotguarantee support. You can still experience the official <b>Riven</b>web site at <a href="http://www.riven.com/"><b>www.riven.com</b></a>.[The official site will be unveiled on 06/18/97]</blockquote><p align="center"><font size="-1">Copyright &#169; 1997 Broderbund Software, Inc.
